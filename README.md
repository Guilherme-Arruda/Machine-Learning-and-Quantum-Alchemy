# Machine Learning and Quantum Alchemy

Short course providing a high-level introduction into machine learning and quantum alchemy methods. Target audience both BSc and MSc level. Requires basic programming skills (in any language). All exercise tasks will revolve around (molecular) chemistry, but do not require particular theoretical chemistry knowledge.
 
Developed at [University of Kassel](https://uni-kassel.de) and [Universidade Federal do ABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br) with support from [CAPES](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br).
